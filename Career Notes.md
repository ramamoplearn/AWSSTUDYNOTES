# Career Notes, 2022

This notes is a roadmap for your career progression and a way of life for you and your family


Some thoughts .....
## One way to look at life
- Family comes first
- Have a meaningful work life balance 
- Be eager when as satisfaction as you can, be eager at a younger age
- My life I was rewarded to have three priorities. Three in a box !!!
  - Family
  - Career
  - Volunteer / Passion. ( not for career, $$$ or family ). P
    - Pure not for personal gains in status, career or benefits. 
    - Just for fun, enjoyment, statistaction and giving back or better sharing our blessings !!!
- The reason is if Family commitments is heavy, you can cutdown your passion efforts.
- If your family commitments slowdown, you can increase your passion
- Same goes to career, you can be aggressive or "stay the course" as your life commitments demand
- Gain knowledge from books, audios, videos, blogs, discusing with acquaintances 
  - Get different view points, then make your own decision... do not just take direction from anyone..

## Career Progression
- Enjoy work
- Increase your influence at work at 7% per year
- If you did not increase your influence for 3 years, see to have a 45% increase in influence inn the third year
- One way to measure influence is $$$ / Compensation
  - So get your compensation to increase by 7% each year, this can be annual or cummulative every 5 years

## R career progression thoughts
- Good Education -- Given
- Work Monday - Thursday on the given job
- Friday work on your increasing your knowledge / skill
  - Help another team member in their work
  - Show your work to other, help others with your artifacts
  - explanatory for the team / company, generate a template, generate a process, simplify a process
  - Do something extra ordinary outside of team /company, read a book
    - Get a certification
    - Gain skills in another domain
    - Research on industry trends
   - Share share share, share your work, artifacts, do not keep it to yourselves
     - if you look around the friends who get better jobs are who shared their work
       - Kumud, Amol
   - In America, you have to work without title, then title, $$$ will follow
   - The way to work with GIT and to write this here, as explannatory notes, is from my reading that at Amazon, no powerpoint is allowed, if you want your idea to be shared, it has to be an explanatory notes, with facts, figures, process, etc... 
   - Powerpoint will miss the details... as per Jeff...

## R career progression thoughts
- Corporate will give you comfort but growth may be limited
- In consulting work may be demanding, but growth is unlimited
  - May be worked for my time, this time is different, you do need to check or validate
- In startup where this younger generation are going that may be different, which I have no experience
  - Open for any office man job at any kids startup... I have a few words out many years ago
    - Nothing technical, just making sure office supplies are in, toileraries are sufficient and food order will arrive in time


## So what is in there for me 
 - Did you get your 7% increase in influence the last 3 year or the last 5 years ?
 - So what you want to do to increase the influence / leverage ?
 - How can I get noticed from the crowd ?
 - What is my Strengths. Spend the $10, this may be a $10 well spent...

## Life career choices
- Enjoy every moment, every day
- Do not chase for permanent solution in a temporary life
- Enough

  "At a party give by a billionaire, Kurt Vonnegut informs his pal, Josepth Heller, that their host, a hedge fund manager, had made more money in a single day than Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel Catch-22 over its whole history. Heller responds, 'Yes, but I have something he will never have...enough."
