# Career Notes, 2022

This notes is a roadmap for your career progression and a way of life for you and your family


Some thoughts .....

- Family comes first
- Have a meaningful work life balance
- Be eager when as soonn as you can, be eager at a younger age
- My life I was rewarded to have three priorities 
  - Family
  - Career
  - Volunteer / Passion
- The reasonn is if Family commitments is heavy, you can cutdown your passion efforts.
- If your family commitments slowdown, you can increase your passion
- Same goes to career, you can be aggressive or "stay the course" as your life commitments demand
