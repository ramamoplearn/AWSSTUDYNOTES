# Career Notes, 2022

This notes is a roadmap for your career progression and a way of life for you and your family


Some thoughts .....
## One way to look at life
- Family comes first
- Have a meaningful work life balance
- Be eager when as soonn as you can, be eager at a younger age
- My life I was rewarded to have three priorities 
  - Family
  - Career
  - Volunteer / Passion
- The reasonn is if Family commitments is heavy, you can cutdown your passion efforts.
- If your family commitments slowdown, you can increase your passion
- Same goes to career, you can be aggressive or "stay the course" as your life commitments demand

## Career Prgression
- Enjoy work
- Increase your influence at work at 15% per year
- If you did not increase your influence for 3 years, see to have a 45% increase in influence inn the third year
- One way to measure influence is $$$ / Compensation
  - So get your compensation to increase by 10-15% each year, this can be annual or cummulative every 5 years
